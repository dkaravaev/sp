# Stochastic Programming + Pattern Recognition Tasks 

## Task1

Make [KMeans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) realization on Python and compress with it 3 images.
The result are listed in task1 folder.

## Task2

Find the optimal cluster number for KMeans on specific picture with [Calinski-Harabasz Criterion](https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/clustering.evaluation.calinskiharabaszevaluation-class.html?requestedDomain=www.mathworks.com) and [Davies-Bouldin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davies%E2%80%93Bouldin_index). Find the optimal cluster number for KMeans on simple (x, y) dataset with [Rand Criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rand_index) and [Fowlkes-Mallows Criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowlkes%E2%80%93Mallows_index).
